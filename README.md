# Post-Api
My first rest api that allow you to make a "post" that contains title, description and date and post it to the server,
it has some other functionalities like getting posts updating and deleting them,
its very basic but its fun and it can be the base to other great api's
Created using Node.js, express and MongoDB, Created for practice and fun, enjoy!
